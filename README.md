### Question 1:

What was your approach for this project? Did it change as you developed the app further?

### Answer 1:

After reading the instruction carefully and following the tips which were given, I started on the project by creating the folder structure and installing the required packages which include `formik`, `Yup`, and `antd`.

used `formik` to deal with forms.
used `Yup` for form validation.
used `antd` for user interface.
used `localstorage` to store and retrieve data
used `react-router-dom` v6 for routing.

Following that, I explored about `formik`, `antd`, changes introduced in `react-router-dom` v6. After creating the form, adding validations along with respective error messages, I started on writing the logic for the requested operations and winded up the project after some basic ui fixies.

I believe every task comes with responsibility and teaches us something to sharpen our skills. I took this task as an opportunity to learn about `formik`, `antd`, and `react-router-dom` v6. It definitely helped me in leveling up my skills.

### Question 2:

What were the challenges you faced?

### Answer 2 :

Given the time constraint, I faced some issues in finding appropriate props for setting values and dealing with `formik`.
I had to do research for finding a prop `enableReinitialize` to reinitialize the form after edit operation.
I had to find alternate ways for dealing with state in history object as v6 no longer exposes the history object.

### Question 3:

How differently will you do if you had a couple of more days to complete the assignment? What if you have one full month?

### Answer 3 :

If I had one full month in developing this project, I would have made the user interface more interactive, friendly.
I would have created a responsive version for the same. I would have added a graph for showing per day entries.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
